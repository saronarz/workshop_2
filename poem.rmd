Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,  
We stopped by a mountain pasture to say 'Whose colt?'  
A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,  
The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head  
And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.  
We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,  
And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,  
Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.  
'I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow.  
He isn't winter-broken. It isn't play  
With the little fellow at all. He's running away.
